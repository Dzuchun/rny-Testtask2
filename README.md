# rny-Testtask2

This is my secord expirience with ASP.NET.

This litle server allows to get and delete some information about books.

Before using please consider stripping ".template" suffix of "appsettings.json.template" file. Currently, the only important thing in it - SecretDeleteKey field. This is a key used in book delete requests.

Also, I've written a little Angular-based frontend for it: https://github.com/Dzuchun/rny-TestFront.
